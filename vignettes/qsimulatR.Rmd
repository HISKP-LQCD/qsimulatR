# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is attracting a lot of attention recently due to
significant advances in constructing quantum devices. While this does
not yet mean that large scale quantum computing is possible, it might
be so in the future. Thus, for the time being, quantum simulators play
an important role for inventing and testing of algorithms.

Quantum computing requires a different approach to programming than
many of us are used to on classical computers. The more or less
standard approach is now via so-called **quantum circuits**,
a generalisation of classical logical circuits (or better classical
reversible circuits). The basic entity of such a circuit is a **quantum
state** composed out of qubits. Such states can be manipulated via
**unitary quantum gates**. Classical information can be retrieved by
performing (projective) **measurements**.

# qsimulatR Package

By the nature of quantum mechanics, quantum algorithms are
probabilistic algorithms. As such, `R` could be the natural language
to analyse the corresponding results. The package `qsimulatR`
presented here provides a quantum simulator which allows one to
implement quantum circuits in `R`. `qsimulatR` uses `S4` classes to
implement quantum state manipulations intuitively via multiplications
`*`. 

General single qubit gates and general controlled single qubit gates
can be easily defined. For convenience, it currently directly provides
the most common gates (X, Y, Z, H, Z, S, T, Rx, Ry, Rz, CNOT, SWAP,
toffoli or CCNOT, CSWAP). `qsimulatR` supports plotting
of quantum circuits.

Since one important platform for real quantum devices is given by
`qiskit`, `qsimulatR` is able to export circuits into `qiskit`.
The such exported code can in principle be run directly
on IBM's real quantum hardware.

We have developed `qsimulatR` for a lecture on _Quantum Computing_
taught at the University of Bonn, Germany. It is available on CRAN
since last week.

## A quantum state

The basis for the simulator is a quantum state, called `qstate` in
`qsimulatR` realised as an S4 class. One can generate a `qstate` with
a number of qubits (here 2 by `nbits=2`) as follows

```{r}
library(qsimulatR)
x <- qstate(nbits=2)
x
```

Per default this state is in the computational basis with all qubits
in the $|0\rangle$ state. The convention is that the least significant
bit is printed as the rightmost qubit, the most significant one as the
leftmost qubit. In front of the basis state the _complex_ amplitude of
this state is printed.

The basis state can also be supplied to
`qstate` as an optional argument, e.g.

```{r}
CatInBox <- qstate(nbits=1, basis=c("|dead>", "|alive>"))
CatInBox
```

and also the coefficients of the separate basis states can be set,
even though that is not realistic on a real quantum device and should
be avoided for other than testing purposes

```{r}
CatInBox <- qstate(nbits=1, basis=c("|dead>", "|alive>"),
                   coefs=as.complex(c(1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))))
CatInBox
```

Quantum circuits can be visualised very easily. Each qubit is
represented by a horizontal line. In `qsimulatR` a circuit can be
plotted by plotting a `qstate` object.
If no gate was applied yet, the corresponding image is not very interesting

```{r, fig.align="center"}
plot(x, qubitnames=c("qubit1", "qubit2"))
```

## Applying single qubit gates

As said above, quantum states can be manipulated via unitary
gates. For this the `*` operator is overloaded for certain types of
gates applied to `qstate` objects. One important gate is the so-called
**Hadamard** gate, which has the matrix representation
\[
H\ =\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 \\
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\]
The Hadamard gate is available in `qsimulatR` as `H(j)`. Every single
qubit gate needs to be supplied with the information `j` to which qubit it
is to be applied to. The application to the first qubit (i.e. the
least significant one) looks as follows:

```{r}
x <- qstate(nbits=2)
y <- H(1) * x
y
```

In `R` we start counting with 1, which corresponds to the least
significant bit (or the rightmost one in $|00\rangle$). `H(1)` returns
an S4 object of class `sqgate` and the multiplication with `qstate` is
overloaded.

Now, with a gate included, plotting the state represents the quantum
circuit used to generate the state, for instance

```{r, fig.align="center"}
plot(y)
```

Even if there is a list of predefined standard single qubit gates
(`H`, `X`, `Z`, `Y`, `Rz`, `Ry`, `Rz`, `Id`, `S`, `Tgate`), any single
qubit gate can be defined as follows via its matrix representation

```{r}
myGate <- function(bit) {
  methods::new("sqgate", bit=as.integer(bit),
               M=array(as.complex(c(1,0,0,-1)), dim=c(2,2)),
               type="myGate")
}
```

From now on this gate can be used like the predefined ones

```{r}
z <- myGate(1) * y
z
```

The argument `M` must be a unitary $2\times 2$ complex valued matrix,
which in this case is the third Pauli matrix predefined as `Z`. If `M`
is not unitary, an error will the thrown.

### Truth Table

Sometimes it is useful to look at the quantum analogon of a truth table of a 
gate as it immediately shows how every qubit is influenced depending on the 
other qubits. It can provide a consistency check for a newly implemented gate, 
too. The truth table of a single qubit gate (here the `X` gate) can be obtained 
as follows

```{r}
truth.table(X, 1)
```

## Multi-qubit gates

For universal quantum computing more than single qubit gates are
necessary. The most important two-qubit gate is the controlled `NOT`
or `CNOT` gate. It has the truth table

```{r}
truth.table(CNOT, 2)
```

and can for instance be used as follows to generate a Bell state

```{r}
z <- CNOT(c(1,2)) * y
z
```

which is maximally entangled.
Plotting the resulting circuit looks as follows

```{r, fig.align="center"}
plot(z)
```

The arguments to `CNOT` are the control and target bit in this
order. Again, arbitrary controlled single qubit gates can be generated
as follows

```{r}
CX12 <- cqgate(bits=c(1L, 2L), gate=X(2L))
z <- CX12 * y
z
```

which in this case is the `CNOT` gate again with control bit 1 and
target bit 2. `cqgate` is a convenience function to generate a new S4
object of S4 class `cqgate`. Note that a similar function `sqgate` for
single qubit gates is available. The `gate` argument to `cqgate` can
be any `sqgate` object.

Another widely used two-qubit gate is the `SWAP` gate, which swaps
two qubits, in the following example the first and the second qubit:

```{r, fig.align="center"}
z <- SWAP(c(1,2)) * y
z
plot(z)
```

The order of the bits supplied to `SWAP` is irrelevant, of course

```{r, fig.align="center"}
z <- SWAP(c(2,1)) * y
z
```

Finally, there are also the controlled `CNOT` or Toffoli gate and the
controlled `SWAP` or Fredkin gate available. The next code snipped shows the
application of the `CCNOT` gate.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
x <- H(1) *(H(2) * qstate(3))
x
y <- CCNOT(c(1,2,3)) * x
y
plot(y)
```

The arguments to `CCNOT` is a vector of three integers. The first two
integers are the control bits, the last one the target bit.

Similarly, the `CSWAP` or Fredkin gate

```{r, fig.align="center"}
y <- CSWAP(c(1,2,3)) * x
y
plot(y)
```

## Multi-gate circuits as functions

You might want to use specific circuits of several gates more than once and therefore find it tedious to type it completely every time you use it. Defining a new gate combining all of the operations might not be as easy either. In these cases we find it convenient to define generating functions of the form

```{r}
myswap <- function(bits){
	function(x){
		CNOT(bits) * (CNOT(rev(bits)) * (CNOT(bits) * x))
	}
}
```

where an outer function takes any required information concerning the circuit. It then returns a function that applies given circuit to a state.

Our example above implements a `SWAP` using only `CNOT` gates as can be checked with the truth table:

```{r}
truth.table(myswap, 2)
```

We can plot the circuit in the way we are used to as well.

```{r}
circuit <- myswap(1:2)
plot(circuit(qstate(2)))
```

## Measurements

At any point single qubits can be measured

```{r, fig.align="center"}
res <- measure(y, 1)
summary(res)
plot(res$psi)
```

In this case the third qubit is *measured* and its value is stored in
`res$value`. The wave function of the quantum state collapses, the
result of which is stored again as a `qstate` object in `res$psi`.

Such a measurement can be repeated, say 1000 times, for qubit 3

```{r, fig.align="center"}
rv <- measure(y, 3, rep=1000)$value
hist(rv, freq=FALSE, main="Probability for Qubit 3")
```

where we read of from the wave function that the ratio should be $3:1$
for values $0$ and $1$, which is well reproduced.

## Quantum Fourier Trafo and other higher level functionality

The quantum Fourier transformation (qFT) is an important building
block of many algorithms. `qsimulatR` provides an implementation of
qFT via the `qft` function.

```{r}
y <- qstate(3)
y <- qft(y, inverse=FALSE)
plot(y)
```

`qft` can also apply the inverse qFT by setting
`inverse=TRUE`. Moreover, the qFT can also be applied to a subset of
qubits only, here to qubits two to four while the first qubit is left
alone:

```{r}
y <- qstate(4)
y <- qft(y, bits=c(2:4), inverse=FALSE)
plot(y)
```

For more details we refer to the `qft` vignette. Based on the
qFT algorithm the **phase estimation** algorithm can be defined. It is
implemented in `qsimulatR` as the function `phase_estimation`. The
phase estimation allows to estimate the phase of eigenvalues of unitary
operators (all eigenvalues $\lambda=e^{2\pi i\varphi}$ of unitary
operators $U$ have modulus 1, i.e. $|\lambda| = 1$). In order to call the
`phase_estimation` function, a wrapper function for the unitary
operator needs to be defined, e.g. for the `NOT` operator, which is
the Pauli `X` matrix
\[
X\ =\ \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The wrapper function then needs to implement a controlled `NOT`
operation, i.e. the `CNOT` operator, to the power $2^j$. $X^2=1$, thus
we can implement it as follows

```{r}
cnotwrapper <- function(c, j, x, k) {
  if(j == 1) return(CNOT(c(c, k)) * x)
  return(Id(k) * x)
}
```

For the `phase_estimation` function, this wrapper function must have
the control qubit `c` as first argument, as the second the
integer power `j` and as the third the `qstate` object `x`. Additional 
parameters to the wrapper function can be passed via the `...`
argument to `phase_estimation`. 

`X` has eigenvalues $\lambda_\pm=\pm1$. Thus, the corresponding
phases are $\varphi = 0$ and $\varphi= 1/2$. Both can be represented
as binary fractions with a single bit exactly. Here we use $t=2$ qubits
in the call of `phase_estimation` determined by the length of the
`bitmask` argument to the function. In addition, the phase estimation
procedure needs a trial state. If possible, this trial state should be
in an eigenstate of the unitary operator. However, also a random
superposition of eigenstates works. In the example, we use the first
qubit as the trial state, which we initialise in the state
$(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, which is an eigenstate of
$X$ with eigenvalue $+1$. Qubits two and three are used in 
the phase estimation function

```{r}
x <- H(1) * qstate(3)
x <- phase_estimation(bitmask=c(2:3), FUN=cnotwrapper, x=x, k=1)
x
```

How to interpret the result? The first qubit stays in the state
$(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, as it is an eigenstate. The other
two qubits encode the phase $\varphi=0.00$ in binary fraction
representation. Using the other eigenstate $(|0\rangle -
|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ leads to

```{r}
x <- H(1) * (X(1) * qstate(3))
x <- phase_estimation(bitmask=c(2:3), FUN=cnotwrapper, x=x, k=1)
x
```

and $\varphi=0.10 = 1/2$. More details and a more complex example can
be found in the `qsimulatR` vignette on `phase_estimation`.

# Export to Qiskit

IBM provides quantum computing platforms, which can be freely
used. However, one needs to programme in python using the `qiskit`
package. For convenience, `qsimulatR` can export a circuit translated
to `qiskit`

```{r}
filename <- paste0(tempdir(), "/circuit.py")
export2qiskit(y, filename=filename, import=TRUE)
```

which results in the following file

```{r comment=''}
cat(readLines(filename), sep = '\n')
```

which can be used at
[quantum-computing.ibm.com](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) to run
on real quantum hardware. Note that the export functionality only
works for standard quantum gates, not for customary defined ones.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
file.remove(filename)
```
